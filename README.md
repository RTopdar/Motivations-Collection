# Purpose of this repo

1. It contains quotes from all over the globe so anyone's free to contribute.

2. Right now the repo contains a single html page, which acts as a collection dump for all the quotes different people have to offer. So it's pretty simple to contribute.

3. Later this will be stylised and converted to a proper website, with a proper hosting and a backend where users will be able to upload their own motivational quotes.
